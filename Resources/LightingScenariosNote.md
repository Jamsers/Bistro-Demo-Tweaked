We use "filmic" color temps and sun angles (except for noon), since the level is surrounded by tall buildings and realistic sun angles would leave all of the level in shadow. Luminosity values are still reference though.  
For night time, we use non-realistic "filmic" luminosity values in addition to the "filmic" color temp.  
Reference values for night time are 0.3 lux for the moon with a 4000k temp, and 0.09 nits for the sky. It goes much lower than that when it isn't a full moon, or if it's a cloudy night.  
Godot can handle those values just fine... it's just that they don't look very good.
