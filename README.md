# Bistro-Demo-Tweaked
Bistro demo for [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) showcasing lighting and high quality assets.

Includes [Godot-Human-For-Scale](https://github.com/Jamsers/Godot-Human-For-Scale) to run around the level, and an interface for changing the time of day, resolution scaling, and quality scaling. Appropriate objects in the level are set to dynamic and are physics enabled, to see the effects of lighting on dynamic objects as well.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the Github repository.
2. Download [Godot 4.x](https://godotengine.org/download/) and open the repository folder with Godot.
3. Run the project. (Play button on the upper right corner of Godot's interface)

## *.res Files Reimported
When opening the project for the first time, you may notice hundreds of *.res files get modified in your source control. This is a quirk of the Godot importer and these changes can be safely discarded once project has already been opened once.

## Lightmaps When Project is Cloned
This repo doesn't have lightmaps uploaded because of Github file size limitations. See [LightingScenariosNote](https://github.com/Jamsers/Bistro-Demo-Tweaked/blob/main/Resources/LightingScenariosNote.md) for more details, if you want to use baked lighting in a cloned project.

## Extra Options
Use the Light Change Utility node to change lighting scenarios in editor.  
Includes a profiler to see performance details. [RAM counter not available in release builds](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_performance.html#enumerations).  
You can turn music on or off in editor.
